# Fake Reviews Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify reviews as spam or non-spam using text classification techniques. The dataset used for this project contains labeled reviews, and we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify these reviews. The logistic regression model with hyperparameter tuning is used to achieve this.
